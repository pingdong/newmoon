> ## CQRS
In CQRS, Commands could be implemented as [Unbound Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api/odata-v4/odata-actions-and-functions) in OData. But it brings unnecessary complex. 

Combining RESTful API for Commands and OData for Query is more reasonable decision.
