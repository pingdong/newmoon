> ## Cache 

More information about StackExchange Redis could be found [here](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis)

Microsoft's implementation provides an unified interface to all potential cache service, whereas StackExchagne Redis provides some advance features. 

__Notes__: Since Microsoft Asp.Net Core includes StackExchagne.Redis.StrongName, all projects have to be reference to StackExchange.Redis.StrongName instead of StackExchange.
