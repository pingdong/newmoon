Prerequirements

	Unit Testing:
		None

	Integration / Functional Test
		SQL Server Express, likely installed with Visual Studio

Run:
	Run directly from Test Explorer

Clean Up
	Even Integration / Functional Testing use SQLServer express In Memory DB, a pair of DB files still are created under C:\Users\[Username]\. Those files could be manually deleted, if cleanup isn't executed.

Notes:
	1. Demo purpose only, therefore I haven't done a fully test.
	2. Integration / Functional Testing 
		2.1 All tests can have its own separate setting, in settings.json.
		2.2 All tests run in Stagging environment.
		2.3 Every test recreate database and remove it after testing, so every test won't pollute each other.
		2.4 Since the using of SQLServer express, all tests have to run in serial manner. Otherwise data pollution is expected. 
		2.5 As every setup has to setup the whole web host stack, database and every request is served through whole pipeline, a test likely runs a few seconds.
